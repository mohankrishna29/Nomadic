# Description
I developed a dynamic and vibrant React application catering to vehicle owners seeking to list their vehicles for rent, spanning from land to air travel vehicles. The platform accommodates various owners, allowing them to showcase their vehicles for rent. Additionally, I designed an intuitive interface for owners to monitor their revenues, reviews, and ratings. Leveraging React as a Single Page Application (SPA), I implemented routing to establish multiple routes within the app and utilized protected routes techniques to manage host routes. For design elements, I utilized HTML and pure CSS.

# Initialize a demo project locally
1. Initialize a vite-pages project (with npm 7+):
    execute npm init vite-pages app-demo -- --template app to initialize an app project, or
    execute npm init vite-pages library-demo -- --template lib to initialize a library project, or
    execute npm init vite-pages library-monorepo-demo -- --template lib-monorepo to initialize a library project with monorepo setup.
    If you are using npm 6.x, the extra double-dash before --template should be deleted. For example, npm init vite-pages app-demo --template app.
2. npm install
3. npm run dev and play with the local dev environment.
4. npm run build.
5. npm run ssr. You can disable javascript in your browser, to  verify if it can still render.
